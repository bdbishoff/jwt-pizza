# Incident: 2024-12-04 13:28:20

## Summary

The order a pizza functionality failed to fulfill pizza orders. This happened because the pizza factory stopped working. The severity of this incident was severe as it occurred for 4 hours.

## Detection

The incident was detected when a error request alert was triggered and the JWT-Pizza dev ops team was paged. The team knew that the pizza service was down since the log messages were showing errors everytime someone tried to order a pizza. The improved time-to-detection could be cut down if we had stricter alerts. The alert for failed orders was set too high and led to the alert not being called as quickly as it shouldâ€™ve been.

## Impact

The incident affected external users from ordering their pizza. About 3 active users ran into the issue on the site. Every time they tried to order a pizza it would fail. There were no support tickets submitted or social media posts.

# Action items

Describe the corrective action ordered to prevent this class of incident in the future. Note who is responsible and when they have to complete the work and where that work is being tracked.

In order to prevent this in the future, we can run a script to reset the pizza factory everytime the alert triggers for too many failing pizza requests.
